# Pathfinding on a Weighted Grid

This project aims to find the minimum total path from square S to square F on an N x N grid, where each square holds a positive or negative integer value. The possible moves are up, down, left, or right. The pathfinding algorithm must account for both positive and negative weights.

**Problem Details:**
*Input:* The grid size N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50) and an N x N grid of integers (ranging from -1000 to 1000).
*Output:* The minimum total path value from the top-left square (S) to the bottom-right square (F).

**Algorithms Implemented:**
*Brute-force Algorithm:* A straightforward approach that explores all possible paths.
*Graph-based Algorithm:* Treats the grid as a graph and applies traversal techniques to find the minimum path.
*Dynamic Programming Algorithm:* Uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum path efficiently.

**Objectives:**
Implement and compare the three algorithms.
Analyze the time complexity of each using Big-Oh notation.
Test the algorithms with different inputs and display results.

**Submission Includes:**
Source code for all algorithms.
A report documenting the pseudocode, time complexity analysis, and results of testing.

This project is designed to demonstrate different approaches for solving pathfinding problems in weighted grids and understanding algorithmic efficiency.
